          <p>
            It all started with my father, an electrical engineer, tinkering with computers growing up.  I remember at a young age being taught about the terminal and building my first computer with my dad. Fast forward through many years of experiences as a tech sales consultant and working as a business entrepreneur, adding the skill of building tech was a logical next step.  Welcome to my page.  I am honored that you have taken a moment out of your day to explore my journey as a developer.
